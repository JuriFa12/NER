The project has been developed implementing several methods inspired by the paper "Empirical Study of Zero-Shot NER with ChatGPT" by Xie et al. 2023.
These methods were based on a Zero Shot Learning Approach and the chatBot used to retrieve the Entities was Gemini, using different prompts and finally evaluating the best one.
